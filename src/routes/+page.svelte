				<p class="mb-4">I established Home From Home in October 2019 to offer a variety of dog related services. With
					over 40 years experience of owning dogs and a variety of pets, creating a dog/ animal related business has
					been a dream come true. I now own and run two dog based businesses, Home From Home and Let The Dogs Run. I
					have streamlined Home From Home to offer dog walking weekly on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and
					Homeboarding on the dates agreed.</p>

				<p class="mb-4">Home from Home dog walks and extended walks are based at Let The Dogs Run (<a
					href="https://www.letthedogsrun.uk"
					class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Let The Dogs Run</a>).
					My dog park is situated in Tullibardine just outside Auchterarder. We only offer hour-long social group walks
					for up to 10 dogs in one of our three deer fenced enclosures. This enviroment offers all the dogs the chance
					to be off lead, run free, sniff, play and socialise at their own pace within the safety of our dog park.</p>

				<p class="mb-6">All our services are designed around each dog's individual needs and offer the type of care
					their owners have requested.</p>

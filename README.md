# Home from home static site revamp

Been playing with svelte for a while now, off and on, Now trying to push is as a direct replacement for old wordPress sites that are
effectively just simple static site. These run with minimal over heads and also a lot less security problems and potential issues. 
## Technical-ish stuff

The framework is SvelteKit locally developed in Webstorm, built using vite.
GitHub is doing the hosting through the pages feature and nameservers in DNS settings pointing here.

### Todo

- Initial Branch (Main)
    * ~~Create basic site locally~~
    * ~~Host site on gitHub pages~~
      * change name servers in DNS to point to gitHub
    * ~~Create pages and layout~~ 
    * ~~Add image handler, both simple and gallery style, incl lightbox~~
    * ~~Build~~ and enable form functions
      * Decide on EmailJS or other alternative
